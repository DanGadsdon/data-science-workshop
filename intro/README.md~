Don't worry about remembering all of these function names and options. You can always google them or use ?? to search functions (e.g. try searching `??histogram`). RStudio has also has an autocompletion function (e.g. try typing `matrix()` in the console and then press `TAB`). If you hover the cursor on the options that appear, you will have more information about what each of them mean.

#### Installing and loading packages

There are many packages that expand the basic functionalities of R. For example, imagine that we want to make a map of the U.S. The package "maps" is exactly what we're looking for.

First, we install it (you only need to do this once) typing the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("maps", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

Alternatively:
1) Go to the "Packages" tab on the bottom right panel
2) Click on "Install Packages"
3) Type "maps" and click on "Install"

Now, we load the package, which will make all the functions in this package available for you to use. You only need to load the packages once per session.

```{r}
library(maps)
```

You can use the "map" function to  draw a map of the US. Note that you need to specify the option 'database="state"'

```{r}
map(database="state")
```

You can uninstall a package with `remove.packages()` and update it with `update.packages()`, but in practice these are rarely used.
