why networks

basic definitions [with examples]: 
	- nodes/vertices
	- edges/arc, weights
	- undirected vs directed [explain with igraph]
	- graph

networks as data: 
	- adjacency matrices
	- edgelist + node information -> reading data about networks

network visualization: 
	- layouts
	- modifying node properties
	- adding labels
	- adding legends
	- dynamic visualization

node-level properties, measuring importance of nodes: 
	- degree (indegree, outdegree...)
	- centrality (betweenness, closeness, pagerank)
	- diameter, mean_distance

network-level properties: 
	- reciprocity
	- transitivity/clustering
	- connected components
	- giant component
	- community detection 
	- k-core

network modeling: 
	- measuring assortativity, homophily
	- ergm
	- simulation

random network models: 
	- erdos-renyi (random)
	- watts-strogatz (small-world)
	- barabasi-albert (preferential attachment, power law)
